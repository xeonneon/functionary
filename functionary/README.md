# Functionary

## Prerequisites

### Dependent Services

To run the various components of Functionary you'll first need the following:

- RabbitMQ
- A private container registry

The easiest way to run these is via the docker-compose.yml available
[here](../docker/docker-compose.yml).

```shell
# Starting from the root of the functionary repo
cd docker/
docker compose up -d

# To initialize the database with the migrations and initial users/teams/environments
docker exec functionary-django ./init.sh
```

Authentication to these services within Functionary is not yet configurable. By
default, it will be assumed that these services are accessible via localhost on
their default ports. If they are located elsewhere, you can configure that via
environment variables:

- RABBITMQ_HOST
- RABBITMQ_PORT
- REGISTRY_HOST
- REGISTRY_PORT

### Base Image Templates

Packages in Functionary get converted into docker images, which are then
launched as containers when executing a task. The base images for these package
docker images are referred to as templates, and must be built and pushed to the
private registry before Functionary will be able to build packages.

A helper script is available to build and push the images. Make sure your
registry is started before running the script.

```shell
# Starting from the root of the functionary repo
cd package_templates
./build.sh -p
```

If your registry is not located at `localhost:5000`, you can specify the
location using the environment variables described earlier.

## Developer Setup

**NOTE:** These instructions are intended for developers who are looking to get
started working on Functionary. Instructions for general users will be added as
the project matures.

### Python Requirements

Functionary is being developed with containers being the primary target for
deployment. As such, the intention is to officially support only the latest
minor version of python (e.g. The latest 3.X). Be sure to keep this in mind if
you are intending to run the application locally while developing.

### Django Setup

Install the requirements like so:

```shell
# Necessary for compiling psycopg2
sudo apt install -y python3-dev libpq-dev
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Generate the migrations:

```shell
./manage.py makemigrations
```

Run the migrations:

```shell
./manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser:

```shell
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Run the Server

To start the server, run:

```shell
DEBUG=TRUE DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=supersecret ./manage.py runserver 8000
```

The `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is arbitrary and the `8000` at the end is the port
number to listen on. It can be freely changed to anything.

## Start the main worker

The worker process handles communications between the main django process and
any external services, such as the runners. Actions such as creating a Task to
execute a function result in a response being returned right away, but the
actual work is scheduled to happen asynchronously via a worker process. To start
the worker process:

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=INFO \
RABBITMQ_USER=someuser \
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=greatpassword \
./manage.py run_worker
```

Be sure to set the username and password values as appropriate for your
environment. If you are using the included
[docker-compose.yml](../docker/docker-compose.yml), you can use the values of
`RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` and `RABBITMQ_DEFAULTPASS`.

## Start the build worker

When a package is published, the actual work of building the image is handed off
to a separate builder process. To start that process:

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=INFO ./manage.py run_build_worker
```

## Start the function runner

Tasks get executed via a separate runner service. Information on the runner can
be found [here](../runner/README.md).

## Access the Server

The links below assume Functionary is running on `localhost:8000`. Be sure to
use the host name and port number appropriate to your setup.

- [Django admin pages](http://localhost:8000/admin)
- [Browsable API](http://localhost:8000/api/v1)
- [Swagger](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/swagger)
- [ReDoc](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/redoc)

## Compile Custom CSS

The theme colors and other CSS are handled by Bootstrap and customized via Sass
overrides. They exist in `ui/scss/custom.scss`. These overrides along with all
the other Bootstrap defaults are compiled into CSS which is then used by the
app. Compiling the Sass files into CSS files is handled by a bash script. This
script downloads Bootstrap, compiles our custom CSS using our defined overrides
over the Bootstrap base CSS, and then removes any downloaded files.

Then, simply use the following command to compile the Sass files. The output
file is used directly in the HTML files.

```bash
bash ./ui/scss/compile_scss.sh
```
